# PREDICTING-HOTEL-BOOKING-CANCELLATION
Hotels usually accept advance bookings, which signify a contract between the customer and the hotel management. The booking reservation allows the customer to use the service in the future at a settled price. The hotels usually provide an option to cancel the contract before the service date. However, this option to cancel a service puts a dent on the hotelâ€™s revenue, which has to guarantee rooms to customers who fulfill their bookings but also have to bear the loss when a booking is canceled, or a customer does not show up. With the help of data analysis, it is possible to study the factors which contribute towards booking cancellation. Although predicting emergency decisions is almost next to impossible, the models will predict the likelihood of the cancellations with the help of data analysis.  

For the project, the dataset has been obtained from Kaggle, as it was suitable for building predictive models. Different models such as Regression, Classification tree, Knn, Random Forest, Bagging were tried on the dataset. Through the analysis, it was found that if hotels can make use of factors that are within their control to implement measures such as improving their services or setting a favorable price, they will be able to reduce the frequency of booking cancellations.
